h4. Autorun on start

Since Mongeez maintains a record of which changesets have been applied, you can avoid manually updating the database by
taking advantage of the plugin's auto-run feature. By default this is disabled, but you can enable it by adding a
setting to to Config.groovy:

{code}
grails.mongeez.updateOnStart = true
{code}

This is more commonly used for development and QA environments than in production.
